	<h2>Sophisticated Audio Playback for the web</h2>
	<p>
		Jukebox is a component to handle the playback of music and sound
		effects across multiple web browsers and operating systems. <br>
		It is designed for ultra-low performance environments, such as
		mobiles - and is even able to deliver Android 1.6+ via Flash fallback.

		</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Flash Fallback</h2>
	<p>
		The (alternative) Flash fallback requires the compiled swf from src/swf/FlashMediaElement.as,
		a compiled version is located in the demo/media/swf folder.
	</p>
	<p>
		Make sure to pass through the correct URL to the swf file.<br>
		See <a href="details#settings-player">jukebox.Player Settings</a> for more details.
