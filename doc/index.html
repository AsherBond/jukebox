	<h2>What is Jukebox?</h2>

	<p>
		Jukebox is a component to handle the playback of music and sound
		effects across multiple web browsers and operating systems.
	</p>

	<p>
		Jukebox is designed for ultra-low performance environments, such
		as mobiles - and is even able to deliver Android 1.6+ via Flash
		fallback.
	</p>

	<p>
		This documentation will explain how to use Jukebox and it will
		describe many of the issues we found while developing a proper
		playback environment for mobile devices.
	</p>

	<h2>Important Issues and Hints</h2>
	
	<p>
		<b>Chrome 16.0.912.* (Mac OSX)</b> is a known for timing issues
		with the Audio Decoder. getCurrentTime() will return false
		values that are incorrect, because the internal used
		decoder is not behaving the same way as it should.
		<br>
		Confirmed is that this could be a problem related to VBR
		encoded files.
	</p>

	<h3>iOS</h3>
	<p>
		iOS allows only playback of a single sound in parallel.
		It has also latencies up to 820ms (initial playback) due to the
		implementation of using iTunes as a low-priority thread.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>iOS security model</b> only allows playback of sound using the
		Audio API (and iTunes in the background) if the callstack was
		triggered by an event inside the UI layer. That means, you will have
		to use an element.onclick(), element.ontouchstart() or similar to
		initialize the Jukebox.
		<br><br>
		Take a look at the <a href="../demo/ios.html">iOS demo</a> that shows
		how to bypass the security model for having a background music.
	</p>


	<h3>Android</h3>
	<p>
		Jukebox should work with all third-party shipped web browsers that
		are known to support HTML5, as they ship their own codec implementations.
	</p>
	<p>
		Native WebKit will also support HTML5 Audio, but it depends on if the
		manufacturer ships a codec implementation. Google's policies for the
		Android platform requires a Apache/BSD license based implementation of
		the codec. That's why Android 2.3.2+ devices <q>may have</q> an mp3
		codec installed. Third-party Mods like Cyanogen also support mp3 and
		flac codec implementations.
	</p>

	<h3>Mobile Codec Mess (Fallback solution)</h3>
	<p>
		All mobiles support GSM, so they have the voice codec for GSM installed
		which is based on 3gp / amr. This codec supports bitrates up to 12.2kbit/s.
		While this is a pretty sub-par quality, it is a good fallback solution for
		slow internet connections.
		<br><br>
		The codec is known to work across all Android devices (even on those without
		any other supported codec) and known to work on iOS and WebOS.
